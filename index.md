# How to share your research in a reproducible way
## Cite everything that the replication package relies on
> Citations in the manuscript and the README are the best way of directing readers to these resources and to give credit to the original authors.

{% capture example1 %}
Cite open data. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example2 %}
Cite confidential, but widely used data. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example3 %}
Cite proprietary data. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture rules %}
All datasets, whether public or private, included or not, should be cited. It is good practice to cite software packages, but not required, unless the license terms specifically ask you to do so.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}

## Include all exhibits and the code to produce them ALL DATA THAT YOU ARE ABLE (drill down)
> The package should be self contained so that readers can verify that your analysis code produces the output you included.

{% capture example1 %}
This data is included. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example2 %}
Only exhibits are included. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example3 %}
Only exhibits are included.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture rules %}
Save all the output of the analysis in some standard format into the replication package. Tables can be saved as .csv, .xls or .tex files. It is also sufficient to save the Stata .log file. In this case, please report in the README the line numbers where the readers can find the table numbers. Figures can be saved in .eps, .pdf or .png.

Refer to confidential data questionnaire.
{% endcapture %}
{% include details.html %}
## For files not included, explain how to get them
> The goal is to describe clearly the steps that readers have to take if they want to access the data and software you could not included.

### Example for public use data collected by the authors
The [DATA TYPE] data used to support the findings of this study have been deposited in the [NAME] repository ([DOI or OTHER PERSISTENT IDENTIFIER]). [[1](https://www.hindawi.com/research.data/#statement.templates)]. The data were collected by the authors, and are available under a Creative Commons Non-commercial license.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example2 %}
### Example for public use data sourced from elsewhere and provided
Data on National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) were downloaded from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA, 2016). We use Table 30. Data can be downloaded from https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm, under "Personal Income (State and Local)", select CAINC30: Economic Profile by County, then download. Data can also be directly downloaded using  https://apps.bea.gov/regional/zip/CAINC30.zip. A copy of the data is provided as part of this archive. The data are in the public domain.

Datafile:  `CAINC30__ALL_AREAS_1969_2018.csv`
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example3 %}
### Example for public use data with required registration and provided extract
The paper uses IPUMS Terra data (Ruggles et al, 2018). IPUMS-Terra does not allow for redistribution, except for the purpose of replication archives. Permissions as per https://terra.ipums.org/citation have been obtained, and are documented within the "data/IPUMS-terra" folder.
> Note: the reference to "Ruggles et al, 2018" would be resolved in the Reference section of this README, **and** in the main manuscript.

Datafile: `data/raw/ipums_terra_2018.dta`
{% endcapture %}
{% capture rules %}
Every README should contain a description of the origin (provenance), location and accessibility (data availability) of the data used in the article. These descriptions are generally referred to as "Data Availability Statements" (DAS). However, in some cases, there is no external data used.

- [ ] This paper does not involve analysis of external data (i.e., no data are used or the only data are generated by the authors via simulation in their code).
> If box above is checked and if no simulated/synthetic data files are provided by the authors, please skip directly to the section on [Computational Requirements]. Otherwise, continue.

- When the authors are **secondary data users** (they did not generate the data), the provenance and DAS coincide, and should describe the condition under which (a) the current authors (b) any future users might access the data. 
- When the data were generated (by the authors) in the course of conducting (lab or field) **experiments**, or were collected as part of **surveys**, then the description of the provenance should describe the data generating process, i.e., survey or experimental procedures:
  - Experiments: complete sets of experimental instructions, questionnaires, stimuli for all conditions, potentially screenshots, scripts for experimenters or research assistants, as well as for subject eligibility criteria (e.g. selection criteria, exclusions), recruitment waves, demographics of subject pool used.
  - For lab experiments specifically, a description of any pilot sessions/studies, and computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment. 
  - For surveys, the whole questionnaire (code or images/PDF) including survey logic if not linear, interviewer instructions, enumeration lists, sample selection criteria.

The information should describe ALL data used, regardless of whether they are provided as part of the replication archive or not, and regardless of size or scope. For instance, if using GDP deflators, the source of the deflators (e.g. at the national statistical office) should also be listed here. If any of this information has been provided in a pre-registration, then a link to that registration may (partially) suffice.

DAS can be complex and varied. Examples are provided [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html), and below.

Importantly, if providing the data as part of the replication package, authors should be clear about whether they have the **rights** to distribute the data. Data may be subject to distribution restrictions due to sensitivity, IRB, proprietary clauses in the data use agreement, etc.

> NOTE: DAS do not replace Data Citations (see [Guidance](Data_citation_guidance.md)). Rather, they augment them. Depending on journal requirements and to some extent stylistic considerations, data citations should appear in the main article, in an appendix, or in the README. However, data citations only provide information **where** to find the data, not **how to access** that data. Thus, DAS augment data citations by going into additional detail that allow a researcher to assess cost, complexity, and availability over time of the data used by the original author.

### Statement about Rights
- [ ] I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript. 


### (Optional, but recommended) License for Data
INSTRUCTIONS: Most data repositories provide for a default license, but do not impose a specific license. Authors should actively select a license. This should be provided in a LICENSE.txt file, separately from the README, possibly combined with the license for any code. Some data may be subject to inherited license requirements, i.e., the data provider may allow for redistribution only if the data is licensed under specific rules - authors should check with their data providers. For instance, a data use license might require that users - the current author, but also any subsequent users - cite the data provider. Licensing can be complex. Some non-legal guidance may be found [here](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Licensing_guidance.html).

The code is licensed under a Creative Commons/CC-BY-NC/CC0 license. See [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) for details.

### Summary of Availability
- [ ] All data **are** publicly available.
- [ ] Some data **cannot be made** publicly available.
- [ ] **No data can be made** publicly available.

### Details on each Data Source
For each data source, list the file that contains data from that source here; if providing combined/derived datafiles, list them separately after the DAS. For each data source or file, as appropriate, 
 
- Describe the format (open formats preferred, but some software-specific formats OK if open-source readers available): `.dta`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `netCDF`, etc.
- Provide a data dictionairy, either as part of the archive (list the file name), or at a URL (list the URL). Some formats are self-describing *if* they have the requisite information (e.g., `.dta` should have both variable and value labels).

## Guide the reader on how to get from the data to exhibits
Readers are expert empirical economists but need specific instructions on how to reproduce your analysis.

{% capture example1 %}
This data is included. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example2 %}
Only exhibits are included. 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture example3 %}
Only exhibits are included.
{% endcapture %}
{% capture rules %}
Create a list of exhibits and state which one is produced by which script. If possible, include a master script executing all the necessary steps. Explain if your code requires special hardware or runs for particularly long.
