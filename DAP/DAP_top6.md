### Data Policy

In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

It is the policy of the Quarterly Journal of Economics to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the QJE , prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on a data repository linked to the QJE website. Submissions should include a cover letter in which the Editors are notified if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

Our policies differ somewhat for econometric and simulation papers, and for experimental papers.

For econometric and simulation papers , the minimum requirement should include the data set(s) and programs used to run the final models, plus a description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s). Authors are invited to submit these intermediate data files and programs as an option; if they are not provided, authors must fully cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication who request them. The data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software, but a Readme PDF file documenting the purpose and format of each file provided, and instructing a user on how replication can be conducted, should also be provided.

If some or all of the data are proprietary and an exemption from this requirement has been approved by the Editor, authors must still provide a copy of the programs used to create the final results. We require this because the criterion for exemption from the data availability policy is that other investigators can, in principle, obtain the data independently. These authors must also provide in their Readme PDF file details of how the proprietary data can be obtained by others.

For experimental papers , we have a more detailed policy, including requirements for submitted papers as well as accepted papers. We normally expect authors of experimental articles to supply the following supplementary materials (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original instructions: These should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript, and also provided in full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. For example, if different instructions were used for different sessions, the correspondence should be indicated.
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript.
3. Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyze the data. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of a manuscript is sent in. (Data summaries, intermediate results, and advice about how to use the programs are welcome, but not required.)
4. The raw data from the experiment. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of an accepted manuscript is sent in, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.

Other information, such as applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms, is not required or expected. If it is desired to make this kind of information public, it should be posted on laboratory or authors' websites.

If the paper is accepted by the QJE , the appendices containing instructions, the computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or analyze the data, and the raw data will normally be archived on the QJE Dataverse repository when the paper publishes.

### Data Policy

In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Political Economy has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

It is the policy of the Journal of Political Economy to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers, in particular those that contain empirical work, simulations, experimental work, or numerical computations, must provide to the Journal, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JPE Web site. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the JPE office. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

Our policies differ somewhat for econometric and simulation papers, and for experimental papers.

For econometric and simulation papers, the minimum requirement should include the data set(s) and programs used to run the final models, plus a description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s).

[Submission Guidelines and Policies](https://afajof.org/wp-content/uploads/files/policies-and-guidelines/JF_Submission_Guidelines-Feb.pdf)
-------------
### Code Sharing Policy
Authors of accepted papersthat contain empirical analysis, simulations, numerical computations, or experimental work must provide the programs needed for replication to the Journal of Finance. Authors are also encouraged to include the data along with the source codeif public posting of the data does not violate copyright or confidentiality agreements. If the authors choose not to provide the data, they must include a pseudo-data set thatillustrates the format of the files read by the code so that users can understand and check the functionalityof the code. Authors must notify the JournalEditor at the time of initial submissionifthey are asking for an exception to this policy. Absent an exception granted by the Editor, accepted papers will be published only after the programs are received by the Journal, and code will be made available on the Journal website. Authors are not required to provide assistance and further support to eventual users of the code. More details of the requirements are described below.
1. The authors should provide sufficient details about the software packages, programming languages and data formats to enable usersto run the programs. The code should be suitably commented so that it can be understood by a reasonably adept user.
2. Any person downloading any of the file(s) will need to certify that theprograms will be used only for academic research. Any other use, including for commercial purposes, is strictly prohibitedexcept with explicit permission fromall authors of the published article, or, if the code comesfrom a third-party source, with explicit permission of thecited originators of the code. Academic researchers using the code, or fragments of it,intheir own work are required to acknowledge the origin of the code. Such researchers agree that they will not seek out assistance orfurther support of the authors of the article or cited originators of the code.
3. In exceptional cases, the authors can request, at the time of the initial submission,an exemption from this sharing policy. Examples of exceptions are the use of proprietary, licensed algorithms,or when an authordevelops a novel computational algorithm and he/she wishes delay sharing for some fixed period of time. Whether such an exemption is granted remains at the discretion of the Editor. Moreover, even if an exception is granted, Editors will normally require that non-proprietary routines used for data transformation and auxiliary statistical analysis be posted at the time of publication. Ifan exemption is granted, it will be noted on the published paper that the authors have been granted an exemption fromthe code sharing policy.  
### Submission Rules
...<br/>
k)Submissions can include a supplementary appendix that might include extra tables, extra figures, data description, and proofs. If the manuscript is accepted, the supplementary appendix will appear as an Internet Appendix with the online version of the article at the publisher’s website.<br/>
l)If  your  paper  uses  proprietary  data  (that  is  not  available  for  purchase  by  the academic  community)  and  is  accepted  for  publication,  your  final  submission must be accompanied by an authorization letter showing that the source of the data approves its use in the Journal of Finance.<br/>

### Data and Code Availability Policy

* Content and Scope
  * Data and Software Citations
  * Data Availability Statement
  * Non-Public Data
  * Formats
  * Metadata
  * Version of Record
* Registration of Randomized Control Trials
* Ethics Approval
* Instructions


It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and access to the data and code is non-exclusive to the authors.

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.

Data and programs should be archived in the AEA Data and Code Repository.* Authors will provide access to editors and reviewers, if requested, to both data and programs prior to acceptance. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if access to the data used in a paper is restricted or limited, or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

If data or programs cannot be published in an openly accessible trusted data repository, authors must commit to preserving data and code for a period of no less than five years following publication of the manuscript, and to providing reasonable assistance to requests for clarification and replication.

The AEA Data Editor will assess compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the information prior to acceptance by the Editor.

#### Content and Scope

For econometric, simulation, and experimental papers, the replication materials shall include (a) the data set(s), (b) description sufficient to access all data at their original source location, (c) the programs used to create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, (d) programs used to run the final models, and (e) description sufficient to allow all programs to be run.

For papers collecting original data through surveys or experiments, the replication materials shall also include (f) survey instruments or experiment instructions, (g) computer code for experiment or survey collection mechanisms, and (h) original instructions and details on subject selection. See the supplementary Policy on Experimental and Survey Papers.
#### Data and Software Citations

All source data used in the paper shall be cited, following the AEA Sample References. Citation of software packages is also encouraged.
#### Data Availability Statement

A data availability statement covering both the source data and any derivative data shall be provided in the README file. It may additionally be provided as part of online appendices. The data availability statement shall provide detailed information on how, where, and under what conditions an independent researcher can access the original source data, as well as author-generated derivative data, and must be explicit and accurate about any restrictions, requirements, payments, and processing delays. The data availability statement shall provide information to assure the reader that the data are available for a sufficiently long period of time.
#### Non-Public Data

This policy, with the exception of item (a) above, also applies to papers that use data that cannot be published as part of a replication package or in an openly accessible trusted data repository. Examples include confidential data with identifying information of persons or businesses and data subject to data use agreements or copyrights that prohibit redistribution. When possible, a private (not to be published) version of the data should be provided to the AEA Data Editor and/or a designated third-party replicator who can provide a third-party reproducibility report.
#### Formats

Data: The data files may be provided in any format compatible with any commonly used statistical package or software. Authors are encouraged to provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. Authors should ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is available for every variable in the provided datasets. Codebooks or similar metadata should describe the allowed values and their meaning for each variable. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation for these items.

Code: The programs may be provided in any format compatible with commonly used statistical package or software. Should unusual or costly software be required, authors are required to notify the AEA Data Editor. A master script is strongly encouraged.
#### Metadata

As part of the archive, authors must provide a README file listing all included files and documenting the purpose, format, and provenance of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. The README shall contain the data availability statement and proper citations for all data used.

The README shall follow the schema provided by the Social Science Data Editors' template README.

Common formats are txt, PDF, and Markdown. The README file should not require proprietary software to view.
#### Version of Record

After the data and code deposit is accepted by the AEA Data Editor, it will become the version of record associated with the paper. Corrections and revisions are subject to the Policy on Data and Code Revisions.

#### Registration of Randomized Control Trials

It is the policy of the AEA that randomized control trials must be registered on the RCT Registry. All such registrations shall be cited in the title footnote and elsewhere in the paper as appropriate. Please see the RCT Registry policy.

#### Ethics Approval

If applicable, approval by ethics boards—the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in the United States and equivalent institutions elsewhere—should be demonstrated by including the name of the ethics board and any approval or exemption record number in the title footnote and the author disclosure statement(s). See the Disclosure Policy.

#### Instructions

Detailed instructions for preparing and depositing replication packages are provided in the AEA Data Editor's step-by-step guide.

For more information, see Frequently Asked Questions.



*Other repositories and archives may be acceptable, as long as these are considered to be "trusted" archives or repositories, see guidance. The AEA Data Editor will assess suitability of any such repositories and archives.

This version (September 2020) supplants all prior data policies.

[Replication policy](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/information-authors/editorial-procedures-and-policies)
-------------
### Replication Policy
Econometrica has the policy that all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable. Therefore, authors of accepted papers must submit data sets, programs, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication and some limited sensitivity analysis. Published papers should supply a clear description of the procedures needed to replicate results. When there exist significant hurdles to replication, such as the need to use proprietary software, authors must provide sufficient details for readers to assess the accuracy of the paper's results. (Authors of experimental papers can consult the more detailed posted information regarding submission of experimental papers.)

This material will be made available through the Econometrica supplementary material web-page. Submitting this material indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify it; when doing so such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and Econometrica as the original publishers.  In practice, this would mean that anyone using the material held within the replication package zip must  (i) cite the paper (ii) cite the replication package, both in the manuscript and in the README of the replication package (iii) include a Data Availability statement in package to explain how data was obtained (and give proper attribution) and (iv) include the data files themselves in the package.

At the same time the editors understand that there may be some practical difficulties, such as in the case of proprietary datasets with limited access as well as public use data sets that require consent forms to be signed before use. In these cases detailed data description and the programs used to generate the estimation data sets must be provided, as well as information of the source of the data so that researchers who do obtain access may be able to replicate the results. This exemption is offered on the understanding that the authors made reasonable effort to obtain permission to make available the final data used in estimation, but were not granted permission. We also understand that in some particularly complicated cases programs may have value in themselves and the authors may not make them public. Similarly, there may be compelling reasons to restrict usage, and if we agree we will post a notice on the web site regarding such restrictions.

Requests for an exemption from providing the materials described here, or for restricting their usage, should be stated clearly when the paper is first submitted for review. It will be at the editors’ discretion whether the paper can then be reviewed. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.

## Review of Economic Studies

[homepage](https://academic.oup.com/restud)<br/>
[Data Availability Policy](https://restud.github.io/data-editor/before/#data-availability-policy)
-------------
By submitting to the journal, you indicate that you accept the Data Availability Policy. In short, the default rule is that you are required to submit all code and data necessary to reproduce your work, and permit any reader of the journal to use them.
### Data Availability Policy

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must in principle make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication. The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it. Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher. These will be posted in the Review’s Replication Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below). We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.

As soon as possible after receiving instructions from the Journal Manager, authors of accepted papers are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the Review office. Questions regarding any aspect of this policy should be forwarded to the Data Editor.
#### Econometric and Simulation Papers

Upon acceptance, authors should provide data set(s) and computer programs used in the work.

A Data Citation and a Data Availability Statement should be included for ALL data used in the work, regardless of whether they are provided as part of the replication archive or not, and regardless of size or scope.

If intermediate data sets and programs used for the composition of the final data set are not submitted, authors are expected to provide a description of the final data set construction and to cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication. Data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software. A Readme file listing all included files and documenting the purpose and format of each file should be provided in PDF or Markdown format.

Readme files should include information on the operating system-software version combination used in the analysis and ideally an estimate for computation time (possibly with hardware specifications used in the execution of the programs). Software requirements should explicitly list all modules, libraries, toolboxes and commands used that are not part of the core software. Programs that rely on random number generators should set seeds to allow replication.
If it is necessary to execute programs in a particular order, this should be made explicit in the Readme files. A template README file is available here.

The Data Editor acknowledge that practical difficulties in complying with this policy may exist, as with proprietary datasets with limited access or public use data sets that require consent forms to be signed before use. Exemptions in such cases are possible, but authors must provide interested investigators the necessary information on how to obtain the data (even if the data are provided by a third party at a monetary cost). This information should be provided in the Readme file and a copy of the relevant programs to generate the final results is still required. In some specific cases, computer programs may have value in themselves and the authors may not make them public. Similarly, there may be compelling reasons to restrict usage, and if Managing Editors agree, we will post a notice on the web site regarding such restrictions.

Requests for exemptions should be clearly stated when the article is first submitted. The article will then be reviewed at the discretion of the Managing Editors and the Data Editor. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.
#### Experimental Papers

Procedural information is relevant to evaluate the potential publication of experimental papers. For this reason, we expect authors of (field or laboratory) experimental papers to provide the following supplementary materials at the time of submission:
#### Original instructions

These should be provided in full as an appendix and possibly summarised in the discussion of the experimental design. These should be presented in a way that allows the design to be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. If any accompanying materials, such as experimental instructions, are not written in English, then a translation should be provided. In the discussion of the experimental design, the submitted manuscript must provide information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. Upon acceptance, authors are expected to provide the following additional information:
#### Computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyse the data

As with Econometric and Simulation papers, information on operating system-software version combination should be provided.
#### The raw data from the experiment

Aside from properly summarising those in the submitted manuscript, the data should be provided upon acceptance of the manuscript, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.

As with Econometric and Simulation papers, we understand that there may be a need for exceptions for confidentiality or related reasons. In such cases, when the paper is first submitted, authors should clearly state that certain data or other material cannot or will not be made available, and an explanation should be provided. In such cases, it is understood that interested investigators may contact the authors to negotiate the use of the data for replication purposes.

Requests for exemptions should be clearly stated when the article is first submitted.
The article will then be reviewed at the discretion of the Managing Editors and the Data Editor. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.

### Supplementary Material & Data Policy
1. Supplementary Material

Supplementary material that is not essential for inclusion in the main text of the manuscript, but would nevertheless benefit the reader, can be placed in Online Appendices, and linked from the manuscript. The material should not be essential to comprehension of the article, but should be relevant to the article content. This includes all replication materials.

Data files that are less than 100 MB can be supplied as a zip disc. If your data are 100MB or larger, please deposit them in a public repository that assigns a permanent URL(DOI) or accession number and send JEEA the details. Make sure that the URL name contains information that clearly identifies the authors and manuscript name.

Further information on depositories that authors might consider are here:

[Suggested Information for Data and Code Hosting](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html)
[Useful Tools List](http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Useful_tools)

Supplementary material cannot be altered or replaced after the paper has been accepted, and will not be edited. Please ensure that supplementary material is referred to in the main manuscript where necessary, for example as, “Supplementary material” or, “see Online Appendix Figure 1”. All elements in the Appendix or online appendix should be labeled with A, B, etc.
2. Data Availability Policy

Please read this section carefully as we are unable to enter submissions which do not comply with our policy on data into the editorial process.

JEEA will publish papers only if any data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers which contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work, must provide to JEEA, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JEEA web site.

Below, we provide more details on what should be submitted as part of replication materials for empirical and experimental papers. In general, however, all code necessary to re-produce the tables and figures in papers as well as in the supplementary materials should be provided. This includes code used to run simulations or Monte Carlo studies. We encourage authors to set a seed so the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained).

Authors are expected to cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication, although replicators are also expected to be able to use all materials provided independently.
3. Empirical Papers

For empirical, econometric and simulation papers, authors should provide at least:

* A description of the purpose of each data set and program.
* The data set(s) and programs used to run the final estimation. The data files can be provided in any standard format. Programs can be written in any standard programming language (including higher-level languages).
* A description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s).
* All description files should be provided in PDF format. Include a ReadMe file specifying the manuscript name, authors, folders, filenames and their purpose (e.g., in order to produce Table 4 in the main text).

4. Experimental Papers:

We expect authors of experimental articles to supply the following materials:

* The design of the experiment. Suggested information to provide in a design summary includes: (i) The subject pool and recruiting procedures; (ii) when and where experiments were conducted (manually, online etc.); (iii) procedures to test for comprehension before the experiment (e.g. practice trials, quizzes etc.); (iv) matching procedures, especially for game theory experiments; (v) subject payments, including whether artificial currency was used, the exchange rate, show-up fees, average earnings, lotteries; (vi) the number of subjects in each session; (vii) how long a typical session lasted, and how much of that time was instructional; (viii) any use of deception and/or any instructional inaccuracies.
* The instructions given to the subjects should be summarized as part of the discussion on design, and also provided in full as part of the Supplementary Material at the time of submission. The instructions and design summary should enable another researcher to be able to replicate the experiment protocols.
* If any accompanying materials, such as experimental instructions, are not written in English, then a translation should be provided, together with the experimental instructions in the original language.
* A description of the purpose of each data set and program.
* Any computer programs or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyse the data.
* The raw data from the experiment, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.
* All description files should be provided in PDF format. Include a ReadMe file specifying the manuscript name, authors, folders, filenames and their purpose (e.g., in order to produce Table 4 in the main text).

5. Exemptions

Requests for an exemption from providing the Supplementary Materials described, or for restricting their usage, should be stated clearly when the paper is first submitted for review. The cover letter should notify the Co-editors if the requirements above cannot be met. It will be at the editors’ discretion whether the paper can then be reviewed. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.
6. Proprietary Data

We will consider papers based on proprietary data. If a request for an exemption to the above policy is made based on data being proprietary, authors should inform the co-editors if the data can be accessed or obtained in some other way by independent researchers for purposes of replication. Authors are also asked to provide information on how the proprietary data can be obtained by others in their Readme PDF file. A copy of all other Supplementary Materials (code etc. used produce the final results) is still required, as described above.

[Replication policies](https://academic.oup.com/ej/pages/General_Instructions#data)
-------------

### Replication policies
The Economic Journal requires authors of empirical, experimental or numerical papers to provide documentation of how their results were obtained in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow their results to be replicated. When you submit a paper for consideration, you will be asked to confirm that you are willing to comply with this policy.  It is essential that you request a data exemption at the point of first submission if you face any restrictions that prevent you from publishing your data or, in general, from complying with any of the provisions of this policy.
#### Empirical papers

For papers that contain descriptive, econometric or simulated analysis of data, the authors must provide sufficient detail in the paper (or in an appendix) for the reader to understand the nature of the data used and how it was analyzed to produce the results, as well as a replication package containing the following:

* A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, the data sources (including citations), any manipulation that was carried out to generate the final datasets, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. In case of commercially available or restricted access data sources, detailed instructions (e.g. extraction code) to obtain the datasets should be included in the ReadMe file.
* The raw datasets used in the paper and appendices (including online), including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. If the data is provided in a proprietary format, such as in Stata format, then an ASCII file should also be provided.
* All codes necessary produce the analysis data and to re-produce the tables, figures, and in-text numbers in the paper as well as supplements and appendices. In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained. If the code uses additional packages that are not part of the standard distribution, then these packages should be included so that the code still runs after many years.

Authors who have requested an exemption for the publication of their datasets can either (1) grant temporary distance or physical access to the data to the journal's staff for the sole purpose of replication (the data will not be published), or (2) supply a simulated dataset or a synthetic dataset instead of the actual dataset(s) used for the analysis for replication purposes. The nature of the data used for the reproducibility checks will be indicated on the published version of the paper.

Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for reproducibility.

If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's repository and it will be linked with the paper. Alternative repositories may be acceptable as long as they are considered “trusted” by the journal. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and cite both the replication package and the paper accordingly. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.
#### Experimental papers

For papers that contain analysis of experimental data, we require the authors to provide at the time of submission of the paper (authors are asked to include all information as part of the main pdf file rather than as separate items):

* A document outlining the design of the experiment.
* A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.
* Information on the selection and eligibility of participants.
* Explicit reference to the approval of the Institutional Review Board of one of the authors' institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution).

In addition, before final acceptance, the authors will be asked to submit a replication package containing:

* A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time.
* The programs used to analyze the data and/or run the experiment.
* The raw data collected from the experiment.
* A document outlining the design of the experiment.
* A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation.
* Information on the selection and eligibility of participants.
* A copy of the IRB approval.

Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for reproducibility.

If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's repository and it will be linked with the paper. Alternative repositories may be acceptable as long as they are considered “trusted” by the journal. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and cite both the replication package and the paper accordingly. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.

[Data Availability Policy](https://www.economics.ca/cpages/cje-journal-policies)

### Data Availability Policy
What is CJE policy toward data availability and data confidentiality?<br/>

In 2008, the CJE established a data availability policy which was revised in March 2021. Compliance with this policy is mandatory. The CJE makes data sets, programs, and technical appendices available as supplementary information on the CJE publisher’s site Wiley Online Library.

#### Section I: Objective of the CJE’s Data Availability Policy

It is CJE policy to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented, and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain any original empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the CJE, prior to publication, the data, programs, data citations, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These are discussed below in detail. Any questions regarding this policy should be forwarded to the Managing Editor or the Data Editor.

#### Section II: Implementation of Data and Code Availability Policy

Prior to acceptance, authors will provide to editors and to reviewers (the latter if requested): i) the data set(s), ii) data availability and provenance statements, describing the origin, location, and accessibility of the data used in the article, iii) the programs used to create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, iv) the programs used to run the final models, and (v) a description sufficient to allow all programs to be run. The data availability statements, the program descriptions, and the data citations need to be provided as a README.pdf file. We strongly encourage Authors to use the README Template prepared by the Social Science Data Editors. Authors should provide clear documentation of all code within the program files themselves, and also through the README pdf. The CJE Data Editor will assess compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the information prior to acceptance. This may include actual replication of results in the paper by the Data Editor.

The programs and data can be provided in any format compatible with commonly used statistical package or software. Should unusual or costly software be required, the Authors are required to notify the CJE Data Editor. Authors are encouraged to provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. A master script for programs is strongly encouraged and is a best practice.

The README.pdf must include a listing of all included files and a documentation of the purpose, format, and provenance of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. In particular: i) it should be clear from the README.pdf where to find the specific programs which generate each table and figure in the main text and published appendix; ii) all prerequisites including data, programs, software, (if applicable) operating system should be identified. If applicable, random seeds should be fixed so that Monte Carlo exercises (for example) can be replicated. The CJE strongly discourages tables or figures where values are generated elsewhere and hand-copied into new results (e.g. regression coefficients from a Stata code which are then hand-entered into an Excel code the latter of which generates a figure).

Data should be described in data citations with enough information provided i) to accurately describe the data so that somebody who doesn’t have knowledge of the data can understand its principal and salient characteristics and ii) to be able to re-acquire the data, even if the data is provided. See this link and this link for examples and guidance about Data Citations. For issues arising from restricted access data, see Section II.1 below. Best practices dictate that Authors ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is available for every variable in provided datasets. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation for these items.

The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are restricted access or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met. If some or all of the data are restricted access (as is the case with Statistics Canada or U.S. Census data not in the public domain), and an exemption from this requirement has been approved by the Managing Editor, Authors must still provide a copy of the complete set of programs used to create the final results. The CJE requires this because the criterion for exemption from the data availability policy is based on an expectation that other investigators can, in principle, obtain the data independently. The programs and documentation should be sufficiently complete that after a researcher obtains access to the data (e.g., at a Statistics Canada Research Data Centre, or through the Statistics Canada Data Liberation Initiative) the researcher can create the final set of results with the programs provided by the original Authors. Authors must also provide in their README.pdf file details of how the restricted access data can be obtained by others. This final requirement can be satisfied through the provision of websites. The CJE Data Editor will verify the information, and may contact the data providers identified by the authors. After verification, the README.pdf, programs and submitted data will be posted on the CJE web site.

Additional required information depending on the type of quantitative analysis is detailed in Sections II.1-II.2 below.


##### Section II.1: Requirements for Experimental Papers

For experimental papers, we expect Authors to supply the following supplementary materials (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original instructions. These should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript, and also provided in full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. For example, if different instructions were used for different sessions, the correspondence should be indicated.
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design within the submitted manuscript although this can appear in a Data Appendix.
3. Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyze the data. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of a manuscript is sent in. (Data summaries, intermediate results, and advice about how to use the programs are welcome, but not required.)
4. The raw data from the experiment should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript, and included in the data submission. We strongly encourage authors to deposit raw data and instructions separately from other replication materials, in order to provide greater visibility to the author’s work. Sufficient explanation should be made to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis. If the data is subject to confidentiality, best practices can be satisfied by anonymizing the data to prevent identification of specific individuals.

Submission of other information including applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms is best practice.


##### Section II.2: Requirements for Papers with Self-Conducted Surveys

For self-conducted surveys, we expect the following material to be submitted (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original survey and (if applicable) any special instructions for answering it.
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of survey design within the submitted manuscript although this can appear in a Data Appendix.
3. The raw data from the survey should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript, and included in the data submission. We strongly encourage authors to deposit raw data and instructions separately from other replication materials, in order to provide greater visibility to the author’s work. Sufficient explanation should be made to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis. If the data is subject to confidentiality, best practices can be satisfied by anonymizing the data to prevent identification of specific individuals.

Submission of other information including applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms is best practice.

#### Section III: Special Issues

The CJE frequently publishes special issues devoted to a specific topic. Articles in these issues are subject to the policy guidelines above. However, empirical work in these issues that is not original is not subject to the guidelines regarding data and programs. However, their original source should be noted in the README.pdf with an appropriate citation (See Section II).

[Data and code sharing policy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2021.05.026)
-------------

### Data and code sharing policy
Authors of accepted manuscripts that contain empirical
work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must
make available to the JFE any data, programs, and details
for the computations necessary for replication. As soon as
possible after acceptance, authors are expected to upload
their data, programs, and detailed instructions for use to
Mendeley Data, where it will be published under the author’s choice of reuse license. Alternatively, authors can upload this material in a domain-specific repository. In either
case, a link to the data and programs will appear on ScienceDirect with the article.
Authors should notify the editor-in-chief at the time of
submission if the above requirements cannot be met, along
with a precise explanation. The editor-in-chief reserves the
right to refuse publication of manuscripts whose authors
do not comply with these requirements.
Authors are not required or expected in any way to provide assistance and further support to eventual users of the
code and data.

#### Data
Exceptions to the data-sharing policy include but are not limited to proprietary data owned by third parties whose identity can be disclosed, confidential proprietary data whose owners cannot be disclosed, confidential administrative data, experimental data that violates the confidentiality of the subjects, or hand-collected data the authors would like to keep confidential for a period not exceeding two years. In the case of administrative data or third-party data whose owners can be disclosed, the authors must submit a detailed description of how the raw data were obtained or generated, including data sources and the specific date(s) on which the data were downloaded or obtained. Authors also have to provide details to outside researchers on how to obtain the data. When allowed by the data provider, observation identifiers in the raw data should be disclosed. If the data are confidential and proprietary, upon acceptance of the manuscript, the authors must supply the JFE with an affidavit stating that permission has been obtained for the data to be used in the publication at hand. In the case of hand-collected data, if the authors would like to keep the data confidential for a period of time not exceeding two years, the authors must notify the editorin-chief in a cover letter at the time of submission. If the manuscript is accepted, the data must be submitted to the editorial office at the time of acceptance. It will be held in confidence and be uploaded to Mendeley Data or a domain-specific repository after the embargo period. For experimental manuscripts, we have adopted the policies of the American Economic Review. We expect the authors of experimental manuscripts to supply the following supplementary materials:
* The original instructions: These should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript and also provided in full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. For example, if different instructions were used for different sessions, the correspondence should be indicated.
* Information about subject eligibility or selection: This should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript.
* Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyze the data: These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of a manuscript is submitted. (Data summaries, intermediate results, and advice about how to use the programs are welcome, but not required.)
* The raw data from the experiment: These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of an accepted manuscript is submitted, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.

#### Code
Disclosed code must include the computer programs or code used to convert the raw data into the final dataset used in the analysis. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate replication and to help other researchers understand in detail how the raw data were processed, the final sample was formed, the variables were defined, any outliers were treated, etc. Also required are any programs used to generate the final published output from the final dataset. All of this code must be accompanied by instructions for use. These instructions should include information on the operating system and the version of the software used in the analysis. Software requirements should explicitly list all modules, libraries, toolboxes, packages, and commands that are not part of the core software. Programs that rely on random number generators should set seeds to allow replication. If it is necessary to execute programs in a particular order, these details must be included in the instructions. For those cases in which the data cannot be disclosed, the authors must supply pseudo-dataset(s) to demonstrate that the code runs. It is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that the code works on the pseudo-dataset or the actual dataset if the data can be disclosed. Any person downloading any of the file(s) will need to certify that the programs will be used only for academic research. Any other use, including for commercial purposes, is strictly prohibited except with explicit permission from all authors of the published article. If the code comes from a third-party source, explicit permission must be obtained from the cited originators of the code before use. Academic researchers using the code, or fragments of it, in their own work are required to acknowledge the origin of the code. Exceptions to the code-sharing policy may be granted if the authors invested a great deal of intellectual effort in generating the code and want to keep it private for a period not exceeding two years. In this case, the authors must notify the editor-in-chief in a cover letter at the time of initial submission, and the code must be submitted to the editorial office at the time of acceptance. It will be held in confidence and be uploaded to Mendeley Data or a domain-specific repository after the embargo period. Exceptions to the code-sharing policy will also be granted if all or part of the code is proprietary in nature or if parts of the code reveal confidential information.
