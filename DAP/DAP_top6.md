### Data Policy

In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Quarterly Journal of Economics has adopted the American Economic Review data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

It is the policy of the Quarterly Journal of Economics to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the QJE , prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on a data repository linked to the QJE website. Submissions should include a cover letter in which the Editors are notified if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to post their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, to the QJE Dataverse repository. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

Our policies differ somewhat for econometric and simulation papers, and for experimental papers.

For econometric and simulation papers , the minimum requirement should include the data set(s) and programs used to run the final models, plus a description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s). Authors are invited to submit these intermediate data files and programs as an option; if they are not provided, authors must fully cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication who request them. The data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software, but a Readme PDF file documenting the purpose and format of each file provided, and instructing a user on how replication can be conducted, should also be provided.

If some or all of the data are proprietary and an exemption from this requirement has been approved by the Editor, authors must still provide a copy of the programs used to create the final results. We require this because the criterion for exemption from the data availability policy is that other investigators can, in principle, obtain the data independently. These authors must also provide in their Readme PDF file details of how the proprietary data can be obtained by others.

For experimental papers , we have a more detailed policy, including requirements for submitted papers as well as accepted papers. We normally expect authors of experimental articles to supply the following supplementary materials (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original instructions: These should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript, and also provided in full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. For example, if different instructions were used for different sessions, the correspondence should be indicated.
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript.
3. Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyze the data. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of a manuscript is sent in. (Data summaries, intermediate results, and advice about how to use the programs are welcome, but not required.)
4. The raw data from the experiment. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of an accepted manuscript is sent in, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.

Other information, such as applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms, is not required or expected. If it is desired to make this kind of information public, it should be posted on laboratory or authors' websites.

If the paper is accepted by the QJE , the appendices containing instructions, the computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or analyze the data, and the raw data will normally be archived on the QJE Dataverse repository when the paper publishes.

### Data Policy


In an effort to promote consistent standards and requirements among general-interest journals in the field of economics, the Journal of Political Economy has adopted the AER data availability policy. We are grateful to the editors of the American Economic Review for their leadership in constructing this policy.

*****************

It is the policy of the Journal of Political Economy to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers, in particular those that contain empirical work, simulations, experimental work, or numerical computations, must provide to the Journal, prior to publication, the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These will be posted on the JPE Web site. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

After acceptance, authors are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the JPE office. Complete instructions will be provided to the author with the acceptance letter.

Our policies differ somewhat for econometric and simulation papers, and for experimental papers.

For econometric and simulation papers, the minimum requirement should include the data set(s) and programs used to run the final models, plus a description of how previous intermediate data sets and programs were employed to create the final data set(s). Authors are invited to submit these intermediate data files and programs as an option; if they are not provided, authors must fully cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication who request them. The data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software, but a Readme PDF file documenting the purpose and format of each file provided, and instructing a user on how replication can be conducted, should also be provided.

If some or all of the data are proprietary and an exemption from this requirement has been approved by the Editor, authors must still provide a copy of the programs used to create the final results. We require this because the criterion for exemption from the data availability policy is that other investigators can, in principle, obtain the data independently.

**Code Sharing Policy**: https://afajof.org/wp-content/uploads/files/policies-and-guidelines/CodePolicy.pdf
**Submission Guidelines and Policies**: https://afajof.org/wp-content/uploads/files/policies-and-guidelines/JF_Submission_Guidelines-Feb.pdf
-------------
### Code Sharing Policy
Authors of accepted papersthat contain empirical analysis, simulations, numerical computations, or experimental work must provide the programs needed for replication to the Journal of Finance. Authors are also encouraged to include the data along with the source codeif public posting of the data does not violate copyright or confidentiality agreements. If the authors choose not to provide the data, they must include a pseudo-data set thatillustrates the format of the files read by the code so that users can understand and check the functionalityof the code. Authors must notify the JournalEditor at the time of initial submissionifthey are asking for an exception to this policy. Absent an exception granted by the Editor, accepted papers will be published only after the programs are received by the Journal, and code will be made available on the Journal website. Authors are not required to provide assistance and further support to eventual users of the code. More details of the requirements are described below.
1. The authors should provide sufficient details about the software packages, programming languages and data formats to enable usersto run the programs. The code should be suitably commented so that it can be understood by a reasonably adept user.
2. Any person downloading any of the file(s) will need to certify that theprograms will be used only for academic research. Any other use, including for commercial purposes, is strictly prohibitedexcept with explicit permission fromall authors of the published article, or, if the code comesfrom a third-party source, with explicit permission of thecited originators of the code. Academic researchers using the code, or fragments of it,intheir own work are required to acknowledge the origin of the code. Such researchers agree that they will not seek out assistance orfurther support of the authors of the article or cited originators of the code.
3. In exceptional cases, the authors can request, at the time of the initial submission,an exemption from this sharing policy. Examples of exceptions are the use of proprietary, licensed algorithms,or when an authordevelops a novel computational algorithm and he/she wishes delay sharing for some fixed period of time. Whether such an exemption is granted remains at the discretion of the Editor. Moreover, even if an exception is granted, Editors will normally require that non-proprietary routines used for data transformation and auxiliary statistical analysis be posted at the time of publication. Ifan exemption is granted, it will be noted on the published paper that the authors have been granted an exemption fromthe code sharing policy.  
### Submission Rules
...<br/>
l)If  your  paper  uses  proprietary  data  (that  is  not  available  for  purchase  by  the academic  community)  and  is  accepted  for  publication,  your  final  submission must be accompanied by an authorization letter showing that the source of the data approves its use in the Journal of Finance.<br/>

###Data and Code Availability Policy

* Content and Scope
  * Data and Software Citations
  * Data Availability Statement
  * Non-Public Data
  * Formats
  * Metadata
  * Version of Record
* Registration of Randomized Control Trials
* Ethics Approval
* Instructions


It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and access to the data and code is non-exclusive to the authors.

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication, as well as information about access to data and programs.

Data and programs should be archived in the AEA Data and Code Repository.* Authors will provide access to editors and reviewers, if requested, to both data and programs prior to acceptance. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if access to the data used in a paper is restricted or limited, or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

If data or programs cannot be published in an openly accessible trusted data repository, authors must commit to preserving data and code for a period of no less than five years following publication of the manuscript, and to providing reasonable assistance to requests for clarification and replication.

The AEA Data Editor will assess compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the information prior to acceptance by the Editor.

#### Content and Scope

For econometric, simulation, and experimental papers, the replication materials shall include (a) the data set(s), (b) description sufficient to access all data at their original source location, (c) the programs used to create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, (d) programs used to run the final models, and (e) description sufficient to allow all programs to be run.

For papers collecting original data through surveys or experiments, the replication materials shall also include (f) survey instruments or experiment instructions, (g) computer code for experiment or survey collection mechanisms, and (h) original instructions and details on subject selection. See the supplementary Policy on Experimental and Survey Papers.
#### Data and Software Citations

All source data used in the paper shall be cited, following the AEA Sample References. Citation of software packages is also encouraged.
#### Data Availability Statement

A data availability statement covering both the source data and any derivative data shall be provided in the README file. It may additionally be provided as part of online appendices. The data availability statement shall provide detailed information on how, where, and under what conditions an independent researcher can access the original source data, as well as author-generated derivative data, and must be explicit and accurate about any restrictions, requirements, payments, and processing delays. The data availability statement shall provide information to assure the reader that the data are available for a sufficiently long period of time.
#### Non-Public Data

This policy, with the exception of item (a) above, also applies to papers that use data that cannot be published as part of a replication package or in an openly accessible trusted data repository. Examples include confidential data with identifying information of persons or businesses and data subject to data use agreements or copyrights that prohibit redistribution. When possible, a private (not to be published) version of the data should be provided to the AEA Data Editor and/or a designated third-party replicator who can provide a third-party reproducibility report.
#### Formats

Data: The data files may be provided in any format compatible with any commonly used statistical package or software. Authors are encouraged to provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. Authors should ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is available for every variable in the provided datasets. Codebooks or similar metadata should describe the allowed values and their meaning for each variable. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation for these items.

Code: The programs may be provided in any format compatible with commonly used statistical package or software. Should unusual or costly software be required, authors are required to notify the AEA Data Editor. A master script is strongly encouraged.
#### Metadata

As part of the archive, authors must provide a README file listing all included files and documenting the purpose, format, and provenance of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. The README shall contain the data availability statement and proper citations for all data used.

The README shall follow the schema provided by the Social Science Data Editors' template README.

Common formats are txt, PDF, and Markdown. The README file should not require proprietary software to view.
#### Version of Record

After the data and code deposit is accepted by the AEA Data Editor, it will become the version of record associated with the paper. Corrections and revisions are subject to the Policy on Data and Code Revisions.

#### Registration of Randomized Control Trials

It is the policy of the AEA that randomized control trials must be registered on the RCT Registry. All such registrations shall be cited in the title footnote and elsewhere in the paper as appropriate. Please see the RCT Registry policy.

#### Ethics Approval

If applicable, approval by ethics boards—the Institutional Review Board (IRB) in the United States and equivalent institutions elsewhere—should be demonstrated by including the name of the ethics board and any approval or exemption record number in the title footnote and the author disclosure statement(s). See the Disclosure Policy.

#### Instructions

Detailed instructions for preparing and depositing replication packages are provided in the AEA Data Editor's step-by-step guide.

For more information, see Frequently Asked Questions.

 

*Other repositories and archives may be acceptable, as long as these are considered to be "trusted" archives or repositories, see guidance. The AEA Data Editor will assess suitability of any such repositories and archives.

This version (September 2020) supplants all prior data policies.

## Econometrica
homepage: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680262<br/>
**Replication policy**:https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/information-authors/editorial-procedures-and-policies
### Replication Policy
Econometrica has the policy that all empirical, experimental and simulation results must be replicable. Therefore, authors of accepted papers must submit data sets, programs, and information on empirical analysis, experiments and simulations that are needed for replication and some limited sensitivity analysis. Published papers should supply a clear description of the procedures needed to replicate results. When there exist significant hurdles to replication, such as the need to use proprietary software, authors must provide sufficient details for readers to assess the accuracy of the paper's results. (Authors of experimental papers can consult the more detailed posted information regarding submission of experimental papers.)

This material will be made available through the Econometrica supplementary material web-page. Submitting this material indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify it; when doing so such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and Econometrica as the original publishers.  In practice, this would mean that anyone using the material held within the replication package zip must  (i) cite the paper (ii) cite the replication package, both in the manuscript and in the README of the replication package (iii) include a Data Availability statement in package to explain how data was obtained (and give proper attribution) and (iv) include the data files themselves in the package.

At the same time the editors understand that there may be some practical difficulties, such as in the case of proprietary datasets with limited access as well as public use data sets that require consent forms to be signed before use. In these cases detailed data description and the programs used to generate the estimation data sets must be provided, as well as information of the source of the data so that researchers who do obtain access may be able to replicate the results. This exemption is offered on the understanding that the authors made reasonable effort to obtain permission to make available the final data used in estimation, but were not granted permission. We also understand that in some particularly complicated cases programs may have value in themselves and the authors may not make them public. Similarly, there may be compelling reasons to restrict usage, and if we agree we will post a notice on the web site regarding such restrictions.

Requests for an exemption from providing the materials described here, or for restricting their usage, should be stated clearly when the paper is first submitted for review. It will be at the editors’ discretion whether the paper can then be reviewed. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.

## Review of Economic Studies
homepage: https://academic.oup.com/restud<br/>
**Data Availability Policy**: https://restud.github.io/data-editor/before/#data-availability-policy
By submitting to the journal, you indicate that you accept the Data Availability Policy. In short, the default rule is that you are required to submit all code and data necessary to reproduce your work, and permit any reader of the journal to use them.
### Data Availability Policy

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, numerical simulations, or experimental work must in principle make available to the journal any data, programs, and details for the computations necessary for replication. The submission of this material indicates that authors license users to download, copy, and modify it. Such users must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and the Review of Economic Studies as the original publisher. These will be posted in the Review’s Replication Archive. The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the above requirements cannot be met for any reason (see details below). We reserve the right to refuse publication of papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.

As soon as possible after receiving instructions from the Journal Manager, authors of accepted papers are expected to send their data, programs, and sufficient details to permit replication, in electronic form, to the Review office. Questions regarding any aspect of this policy should be forwarded to the Data Editor.
#### Econometric and Simulation Papers

Upon acceptance, authors should provide data set(s) and computer programs used in the work.

A Data Citation and a Data Availability Statement should be included for ALL data used in the work, regardless of whether they are provided as part of the replication archive or not, and regardless of size or scope.

If intermediate data sets and programs used for the composition of the final data set are not submitted, authors are expected to provide a description of the final data set construction and to cooperate with investigators seeking to conduct a replication. Data files and programs can be provided in any format using any statistical package or software. A Readme file listing all included files and documenting the purpose and format of each file should be provided in PDF or Markdown format.

Readme files should include information on the operating system-software version combination used in the analysis and ideally an estimate for computation time (possibly with hardware specifications used in the execution of the programs). Software requirements should explicitly list all modules, libraries, toolboxes and commands used that are not part of the core software. Programs that rely on random number generators should set seeds to allow replication.
If it is necessary to execute programs in a particular order, this should be made explicit in the Readme files. A template README file is available here.

The Data Editor acknowledge that practical difficulties in complying with this policy may exist, as with proprietary datasets with limited access or public use data sets that require consent forms to be signed before use. Exemptions in such cases are possible, but authors must provide interested investigators the necessary information on how to obtain the data (even if the data are provided by a third party at a monetary cost). This information should be provided in the Readme file and a copy of the relevant programs to generate the final results is still required. In some specific cases, computer programs may have value in themselves and the authors may not make them public. Similarly, there may be compelling reasons to restrict usage, and if Managing Editors agree, we will post a notice on the web site regarding such restrictions.

Requests for exemptions should be clearly stated when the article is first submitted. The article will then be reviewed at the discretion of the Managing Editors and the Data Editor. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.
#### Experimental Papers

Procedural information is relevant to evaluate the potential publication of experimental papers. For this reason, we expect authors of (field or laboratory) experimental papers to provide the following supplementary materials at the time of submission:
#### Original instructions

These should be provided in full as an appendix and possibly summarised in the discussion of the experimental design. These should be presented in a way that allows the design to be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. If any accompanying materials, such as experimental instructions, are not written in English, then a translation should be provided. In the discussion of the experimental design, the submitted manuscript must provide information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. Upon acceptance, authors are expected to provide the following additional information:
#### Computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyse the data

As with Econometric and Simulation papers, information on operating system-software version combination should be provided.
#### The raw data from the experiment

Aside from properly summarising those in the submitted manuscript, the data should be provided upon acceptance of the manuscript, with sufficient explanation to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis.

As with Econometric and Simulation papers, we understand that there may be a need for exceptions for confidentiality or related reasons. In such cases, when the paper is first submitted, authors should clearly state that certain data or other material cannot or will not be made available, and an explanation should be provided. In such cases, it is understood that interested investigators may contact the authors to negotiate the use of the data for replication purposes.

Requests for exemptions should be clearly stated when the article is first submitted.
The article will then be reviewed at the discretion of the Managing Editors and the Data Editor. Exceptions will not be considered later in the review and publication process.
