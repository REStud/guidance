## Replication policies
The Economic Journal requires authors of empirical, experimental or numerical papers to provide documentation of how their results were obtained in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow their results to be replicated. When you submit a paper for consideration, you will be asked to confirm that you are willing to comply with this policy.  It is essential that you request a data exemption at the point of first submission if you face any restrictions that prevent you from publishing your data or, in general, from complying with any of the provisions of this policy.
### Empirical papers

For papers that contain descriptive, econometric or simulated analysis of data, the authors must provide sufficient detail in the paper (or in an appendix) for the reader to understand the nature of the data used and how it was analyzed to produce the results, as well as a replication package containing the following: 

* A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, the data sources (including citations), any manipulation that was carried out to generate the final datasets, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. In case of commercially available or restricted access data sources, detailed instructions (e.g. extraction code) to obtain the datasets should be included in the ReadMe file. 
* The raw datasets used in the paper and appendices (including online), including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. If the data is provided in a proprietary format, such as in Stata format, then an ASCII file should also be provided. 
* All codes necessary produce the analysis data and to re-produce the tables, figures, and in-text numbers in the paper as well as supplements and appendices. In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained. If the code uses additional packages that are not part of the standard distribution, then these packages should be included so that the code still runs after many years. 

Authors who have requested an exemption for the publication of their datasets can either (1) grant temporary distance or physical access to the data to the journal's staff for the sole purpose of replication (the data will not be published), or (2) supply a simulated dataset or a synthetic dataset instead of the actual dataset(s) used for the analysis for replication purposes. The nature of the data used for the reproducibility checks will be indicated on the published version of the paper. 

Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for reproducibility. 

If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's repository and it will be linked with the paper. Alternative repositories may be acceptable as long as they are considered “trusted” by the journal. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and cite both the replication package and the paper accordingly. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements. 
### Experimental papers

For papers that contain analysis of experimental data, we require the authors to provide at the time of submission of the paper (authors are asked to include all information as part of the main pdf file rather than as separate items): 

* A document outlining the design of the experiment. 
* A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation. 
* Information on the selection and eligibility of participants. 
* Explicit reference to the approval of the Institutional Review Board of one of the authors' institutions (IRB approval number, date, name of the institution). 

In addition, before final acceptance, the authors will be asked to submit a replication package containing: 

* A ReadMe file (ReadMe.pdf) describing the content of the package, how the data and programs can be used to replicate the results in the paper, the version of the software the code was written for and the respective versions of extra packages, as well as an estimate of the computation time. 
* The programs used to analyze the data and/or run the experiment.
* The raw data collected from the experiment. 
* A document outlining the design of the experiment. 
* A copy of the instructions given to participants, in both the original language and an English translation. 
* Information on the selection and eligibility of participants. 
* A copy of the IRB approval. 

Acceptance will only be granted after the results have been checked for reproducibility. 

If the paper is accepted for publication, the replication package will be posted on the journal's repository and it will be linked with the paper. Alternative repositories may be acceptable as long as they are considered “trusted” by the journal. Submission indicates that you license users to download, copy, and modify this material. Users of the material must acknowledge all authors as the original creators and cite both the replication package and the paper accordingly. The editorial board of the Economic Journal reserves the right to refuse publication of those papers whose authors do not comply with these requirements.
