## Data Availability Policy
What is CJE policy toward data availability and data confidentiality?<br/>

In 2008, the CJE established a data availability policy which was revised in March 2021. Compliance with this policy is mandatory. The CJE makes data sets, programs, and technical appendices available as supplementary information on the CJE publisher’s site Wiley Online Library.
 
### Section I: Objective of the CJE’s Data Availability Policy

It is CJE policy to publish papers only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented, and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Authors of accepted papers that contain any original empirical work, simulations, or experimental work must provide to the CJE, prior to publication, the data, programs, data citations, and other details of the computations sufficient to permit replication. These are discussed below in detail. Any questions regarding this policy should be forwarded to the Managing Editor or the Data Editor.
 
### Section II: Implementation of Data and Code Availability Policy

Prior to acceptance, authors will provide to editors and to reviewers (the latter if requested): i) the data set(s), ii) data availability and provenance statements, describing the origin, location, and accessibility of the data used in the article, iii) the programs used to create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, iv) the programs used to run the final models, and (v) a description sufficient to allow all programs to be run. The data availability statements, the program descriptions, and the data citations need to be provided as a README.pdf file. We strongly encourage Authors to use the README Template prepared by the Social Science Data Editors. Authors should provide clear documentation of all code within the program files themselves, and also through the README pdf. The CJE Data Editor will assess compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the information prior to acceptance. This may include actual replication of results in the paper by the Data Editor. 

The programs and data can be provided in any format compatible with commonly used statistical package or software. Should unusual or costly software be required, the Authors are required to notify the CJE Data Editor. Authors are encouraged to provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. A master script for programs is strongly encouraged and is a best practice.

The README.pdf must include a listing of all included files and a documentation of the purpose, format, and provenance of each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. In particular: i) it should be clear from the README.pdf where to find the specific programs which generate each table and figure in the main text and published appendix; ii) all prerequisites including data, programs, software, (if applicable) operating system should be identified. If applicable, random seeds should be fixed so that Monte Carlo exercises (for example) can be replicated. The CJE strongly discourages tables or figures where values are generated elsewhere and hand-copied into new results (e.g. regression coefficients from a Stata code which are then hand-entered into an Excel code the latter of which generates a figure).

Data should be described in data citations with enough information provided i) to accurately describe the data so that somebody who doesn’t have knowledge of the data can understand its principal and salient characteristics and ii) to be able to re-acquire the data, even if the data is provided. See this link and this link for examples and guidance about Data Citations. For issues arising from restricted access data, see Section II.1 below. Best practices dictate that Authors ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is available for every variable in provided datasets. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation for these items.

The Managing Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper are restricted access or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met. If some or all of the data are restricted access (as is the case with Statistics Canada or U.S. Census data not in the public domain), and an exemption from this requirement has been approved by the Managing Editor, Authors must still provide a copy of the complete set of programs used to create the final results. The CJE requires this because the criterion for exemption from the data availability policy is based on an expectation that other investigators can, in principle, obtain the data independently. The programs and documentation should be sufficiently complete that after a researcher obtains access to the data (e.g., at a Statistics Canada Research Data Centre, or through the Statistics Canada Data Liberation Initiative) the researcher can create the final set of results with the programs provided by the original Authors. Authors must also provide in their README.pdf file details of how the restricted access data can be obtained by others. This final requirement can be satisfied through the provision of websites. The CJE Data Editor will verify the information, and may contact the data providers identified by the authors. After verification, the README.pdf, programs and submitted data will be posted on the CJE web site.

Additional required information depending on the type of quantitative analysis is detailed in Sections II.1-II.2 below.
 

#### Section II.1: Requirements for Experimental Papers

For experimental papers, we expect Authors to supply the following supplementary materials (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original instructions. These should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design in the submitted manuscript, and also provided in full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a reasonably skilled experimentalist. For example, if different instructions were used for different sessions, the correspondence should be indicated.
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of experimental design within the submitted manuscript although this can appear in a Data Appendix. 
3. Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the experiment and/or to analyze the data. These should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript and provided in full as an appendix when the final version of a manuscript is sent in. (Data summaries, intermediate results, and advice about how to use the programs are welcome, but not required.)
4. The raw data from the experiment should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript, and included in the data submission. We strongly encourage authors to deposit raw data and instructions separately from other replication materials, in order to provide greater visibility to the author’s work. Sufficient explanation should be made to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis. If the data is subject to confidentiality, best practices can be satisfied by anonymizing the data to prevent identification of specific individuals.

Submission of other information including applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms is best practice.
 

#### Section II.2: Requirements for Papers with Self-Conducted Surveys

For self-conducted surveys, we expect the following material to be submitted (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time of submission):

1. The original survey and (if applicable) any special instructions for answering it. 
2. Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions based on past participation in experiments, college major, etc. This should be summarized as part of the discussion of survey design within the submitted manuscript although this can appear in a Data Appendix.
3. The raw data from the survey should be summarized as appropriate in the submitted manuscript, and included in the data submission. We strongly encourage authors to deposit raw data and instructions separately from other replication materials, in order to provide greater visibility to the author’s work. Sufficient explanation should be made to make it possible to use the submitted computer programs to replicate the data analysis. If the data is subject to confidentiality, best practices can be satisfied by anonymizing the data to prevent identification of specific individuals.

Submission of other information including applications to Institutional Review Boards, consent forms, or Web signup and disclosure forms is best practice. 
 
### Section III: Special Issues

The CJE frequently publishes special issues devoted to a specific topic. Articles in these issues are subject to the policy guidelines above. However, empirical work in these issues that is not original is not subject to the guidelines regarding data and programs. However, their original source should be noted in the README.pdf with an appropriate citation (See Section II).
