# Check MISQ policy for the new, more general version of RRS rules
If it was implemented, I copied the relating part of journal policy.

    1. General: " The data sets used to conduct the main tests reported in the paper with meta-data describing the fields. "

    2. Primary Data

    3. Secondary Data: b) " If data cannot be provided, please provide:" reason, evidence, alternatives.

    4. Data extracts: “ The data sets used to conduct the main tests reported in the paper with meta-data describing the fields. ”

    5. Format: b) " The data sets used to conduct the main tests reported in the paper with meta-data describing the fields. "

    6. Data transformation: "intermediate stages of data preparation and manipulation (e.g., transformations, treatment of missing values) to enable readers to understand how the author(s) arrived at the final tests"

    7. Analysis: "If program code is used in the analysis, provide the executable code, the software command file, or pseudocode, with sufficient comments/explanations, to allow readers to reproduce the process. "

    8. Format: a) “Where suitable, executable code in a virtual containerized infrastructure such as CodeOcean that enables researchers to run the code and examine the results under different scenarios. ” b)  "If program code is used to automate the collection and storage of data, provide the executable code, the software command file, or pseudocode, with sufficient comments/explanations, to allow readers to reproduce the process. "

    9. Instruments: “Data collection procedures and materials: Sufficient details of the setting, sample, materials, and procedures, to allow, at least in principle, a literal replication. If a questionnaire is used, include the full questionnaire with instructions and response options. ”

    10. Exhibits

    11. Citation

    12. Dependencies: b) Sufficient description of the data source and the data extraction process to enable researchers, where possible (e.g., where not constrained by non-disclosure agreements), to access the data source and reproduce the data collection.

    13. Guidance: a) If program code is used in the analysis, provide the executable code, the software command file, or pseudocode, with sufficient comments/explanations, to allow readers to reproduce the process.  

    14. Format: b) “General note:  The American Economic Association has produced a particularly detailed set of guidelines for research transparency in quantitative research.  While MISQ has not adopted that policy directly, we recommend it as a helpful reference for authors looking for detailed guidance:     https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html “

    14. Location: "authors will need to post a set of transparency materials (agreed to with their Senior Editor) on an external research repository " "If the paper is accepted, the transparency materials posted on the external repository will remain available as a permanent, accessible reference. "

Not implemented (or at least not explicitly): 

2) Original primary data

3a) Raw secondary data (I haven’t found instructions about providing raw data, just the Data extracts “data sets used to conduct the main tests”)

3b) It doesn’t explicitly say that the rest of the policy still applies, but I think it does apply.

5a) Common file format

8a) does not explicitly recommend “commonly used format”, but recommends CodeOcean where suitable

10) Save exhibits

11) Data & software citation (not explicitly citation, but asks for “Sufficient description of the data source” which I listed under 12b. Also “If program code is used to automate the collection and storage of data, provide … with sufficient comments/explanations, to allow readers to reproduce the process.  ” here sufficient info should also include infos similar to software citation)

12) Does not asks  README, DAS, software&hardware requirements explicitly, but there are relating parts in the policy

13bc) Nothing about list of exhibits. Not explicitly asks for 13b) but does mention “Sufficient description of the data source” which should cover it.

14a,c) Nothing about README and its format, but it does refer to Social Science Data Editors template (14b)
