| Primary data | 1 | For papers collecting original data through surveys or experiments, include the original data unchanged, with the exception of anonymization and other privacy protection.| |
|Secondary data | 2 | (a) Whenever usage terms permit, include raw secondary data. (b) If secondary data cannot be published as part of a replication package or in an openly accessible trusted data repository, the rest of the policy still applies. | | 
| Data extracts | 3 | You are encouraged to include the data extract used for analysis, especially if source data cannot be published, | |
| Format | 4 | (a) The data files may be provided in any format compatible with any commonly used statistical package or software. You are encouraged to provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. (b) Ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is available for every variable in the provided datasets. Codebooks or similar metadata should describe the allowed values and their meaning for each variable. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation for these items. | |
